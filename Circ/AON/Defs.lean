/-! # AND/OR/NOT Basis — Definitions

This module defines the AND/OR operations and various basis configurations
used throughout the circuit complexity library.

## Main definitions

* `AONOp` — AND/OR operations (negation is free via per-input gate flags)
* `AONOp.eval` — fold-based evaluation of AND/OR on `n` input bits
* `Basis.unboundedAON` — unbounded fan-in AND/OR basis
* `Basis.boundedAON` — fan-in bounded by `k` AND/OR basis
* `Basis.andOr2` — fan-in exactly 2 AND/OR basis (used in Shannon/Schnorr bounds)
