/-! # Valiant's Depth Reduction Lemma

The **length** of a directed path is the number of nodes in it. The
**depth** of a directed graph is the length of a longest directed walk.

**Lemma** (Valiant, 1977). *In any directed graph with `S` edges and
depth `d = 2 ^ k`, for any `1 ≤ r ≤ k`, it is possible to remove
`r * S / k` edges so that the depth of the resulting graph does not
exceed `d / 2 ^ r`.*

Reference: L. G. Valiant, *Graph-theoretic arguments in low-level
complexity*, MFCS 1977. Stated as Lemma 1.4 in Jukna, *Boolean
Function Complexity*.

Note on cycles: depth is defined here as the supremum (in `ℕ`) of
*walk* lengths, with no injectivity requirement on the walk. In the
presence of a directed cycle, walks can be made arbitrarily long, so
the supremum's underlying set is unbounded; by `ℕ`'s convention this
gives `depth = 0`. Consequently, `G.depth ≤ 2 ^ k` is satisfied
trivially (with `F = ∅`) for cyclic graphs, and is the meaningful
bound only on acyclic graphs — the case where Jukna's labeling
argument proceeds.

The proof machinery — canonical labelings, the edge partition by
first-differing bit, averaging, and the relabeling-after-removal
bound — lives in `Circ.Internal.Valiant`.

/-- **Valiant's Depth Reduction Lemma** (Valiant, 1977).

In any finite directed graph `G` with `S` edges and depth at most
`2 ^ k`, for any `r ≤ k`, there exists a set `F` of edges such
that:

* `F` is a subset of the edge set,
* `k * F.card ≤ r * S` (equivalent to `|F| ≤ r * S / k` without
  integer division), and
* after removing `F`, the resulting digraph has depth at most
  `2 ^ k / 2 ^ r`.

For cyclic `G` the hypothesis is satisfied trivially (with `depth = 0`)
and the conclusion holds with `F = ∅`. The substantive content is the
acyclic case, handled via Jukna's canonical labeling argument. -/
